I'm PuMiao, a NLP engineer  in WeiBo Inc., working on developing large language models. 

Prior to that, I have been a student at the State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences supervised by Prof. Xiaolong Zheng, focus on Natural language processing. I received my Master's Degree in June 2021 from the Artificial Intelligence Academy, the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

My research interests are in **Generative AI**. Moreover, my broader interests cover Contrastive Learning, multi-modal models, long context, pretraining and continual pretraining in large language models as well as their applications.

Coding is probably my favorite thing. If you have anything else you want to know, please drop me anÂ [email](mailto:pu.miao@foxmail.com), or comment a message on myÂ [Website](https://enze5088.github.io/) or [homepage](https://pumiao.notion.site/).
