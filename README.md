### Hi there 👋

I'm PuMiao, I a research engineer in Natural language processing.   

My research interests are in Natural language processing, recommender systems, computational advertising, and information retrieval, and broader interests include comparative learning, multi-modal pre-training model, transfer learning, and their applications in advertising, search, and recommendation.


Coding is probably my favorite thing. If you have anything else want to know,  please drop me an [email](mailto:pu.miao@foxmail.com), or comment a message on my [Website](https://enze5088.github.io/).
